# patch-interpolation
A simple implementation of cubic and bicubic (Catmull-Rom) interpolation, including dynamic patches. Initially developed while working at NTNU IHB in Ã…lesund under @hmgaspar. **The patches are restricted to a regular x,y grid.** There are no pressing plans for creating a version with interpolation of all coordinates, but contributions/forks are welcome.

Install as ES Module with npm (requires git):

`npm install EliasHasle/patch-interpolation`

A UMD bundle, compatible with CommonJS and usage in browsers via the script tag, resides in the `build` folder. (Github prevents me from providing a download link.)
